✅ 1. What the Script Does
This script collects important system health information from your Windows computer and saves it into a file named diagnostics.log.

It checks:

🧠 CPU usage

💾 Memory usage (RAM)

💽 Disk storage space

📋 Running processes

📅 Date and time of the system check

The goal is to simulate a real-world troubleshooting report.

2.We will set the powershell to run as the adminstrator
    and run command like changing the directory to where the file is present and then run file using .\filename

🔍 3. What Each Part of the Script Checks
🕒 Line 1: Add Date & Time
powershell
    "System Check - $(Get-Date)" | Out-File diagnostics.log

📅 Adds a timestamp to know when the script was run.

🧠 Line 2–4: CPU Usage
powershell
        "CPU Usage:" | Out-File -Append diagnostics.log

Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor | Select-Object LoadPercentage | Out-File -Append diagnostics.log
📊 Shows how much of your CPU (processor) is being used right now (in %).

💾 Line 5–7: Memory Usage (RAM)
powershell
    "Memory Usage:" | Out-File -Append diagnostics.log
Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object FreePhysicalMemory,TotalVisibleMemorySize | Out-File -Append diagnostics.log

🔍 Shows:

Total RAM
Free (unused) RAM
You can use this to check if your system is low on memory.

💽 Line 8–10: Disk Usage
powershell

"Disk Usage:" | Out-File -Append diagnostics.log
Get-PSDrive -PSProvider 'FileSystem' | Out-File -Append diagnostics.log

📂 Displays used and free space on all drives (like C:, D:)
Helps check if the disk is full or almost full.

📋 Line 11–13: Top 10 Processes by Memory
powershell
"Top 10 Processes by Memory Usage:" | Out-File -Append diagnostics.log
Get-Process | Sort-Object WorkingSet -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 | Out-File -Append diagnostics.log

🧠 Lists the top 10 programs currently using the most memory.
Useful for spotting heavy apps that slow your PC down.
